# Rep. of CATV 95
# This information contains the details about CATV 95 Time Zone.
# The old and forgotten terrestrial meridian crossing the line north of 14th parallel north was used as a local mean time of CATV 95.
# RTF files created by WordPad contain the details of CATV 95 Time Zone.
# First, CATV 95 used the 121°10'E meridian as a basis for Bukal Mean Time 
# (today the building straddles this meridian where the former is based here) which is 8:04:40 hours ahead of UT.
# Then, it switched to current 112°30'E meridian which is a standard meridian of
# the Rep. of CATV 95 Standard Time which is 7:30 hours ahead of UT.
# Info about DST 1962-1964 (2016-12-24):
# The DST was used from 1962 to 1964.
# From the file named 'RepCATV95_1996IssueNumber.rtf' (1996-12-13):
# Read 'Issue #172' from WordPad file named 'RepCATV95_1996IssueNumber.rtf' for standardization of CATV 95 Time Zone.
# Juanders Changed CATV 95's Clocks To Philippine Time (2000-12-25)
# In late 2000, RepCATV95 was forced to standardize its time zone to Philippine Time 
# which starts on 31 December 2000 at 11:30pm local time. Read 'Issue 208' from RepCATV95_2000ISSUENUMBER.RTF
# The Juanders based CATV95's local time on the Taguig City's local time which was calculated from PAGASA's time.
# Anti-Establishment Conservatives Forced The Mexican Date & Time Upon CATV 95 (2007-05-31)
# To prevent anyone from having links with then-detained Philippine President Joseph Estrada who was sentenced to reclusion perpetua
# for plunder but he is set to be released months later, the anti-establishment conservatives (led by anti-Erap supporters)
# coerced CATV 95 into enacting the Issue 356 which replaced the Asian date, being one hour ahead of Hanoi, with American date,
# also being eleven hours behind Colombia. This resulted in time change being made by repeating June 12, 2007, meaning
# that CATV 95 has celebrated June 12 twice. The anti-Erap supporters brutally cursed the supporters of CATV 95 after that.
# This information is available in the file REPCATV95_2007AISSUENUMBER.RTF 
# (RC95's Issue Number Files Are Created By WordPad Because MS Word did not sit very well with CATV 95's documents about time zones)
# Juanders Reverted June 13, 2007 Time Change (2010-03-24)
# As a result, RCATV95's 365-year day calendar will become 364-year day 
# calendar as after jumping from March 31, 2010 23:59:59 to April 2, 2010 00:00:00.
# CATV 95 Urged To Re-Adopt Old Malaya Time (2012-03-30)
# As a response to Jejomar Binay's futile attempts to take over CATV 95, the latter decided to re-adopt the pre-2001 standard time
# which was used between March 1, 1932 and January 1, 2001.
# CATV 95 Forced To Revert To PHT Due To RA 10535 (2013-05-19)
# In 2013, RepCATV95 was again forced to revert its time zone to Philippine Time which is 
# same as local time in taguig city.
# Gratrich & His Henchmen Force CATV 95 To Return To Pre-2001 Time Zone (2015-04-22)
# In 2015, RepCATV95 changed its time zone from Filipino Time to the new Rep. of CATV 95 Standard Time which is UT+7.5.
# Meridian of CATV 95 is situated on the strange building, exactly 152 meters from halang-bucal bridge.
# The rationale for the time change is to have an equal distribution of the early sunrise and sunset.
# Re-introduction of DST (2016-09-22)
# Slated to begin at midnight on 27 September 2016.
# CATV 95 Ends DST Permanently (2016-11-10)
# There will be no DST since 10 Nov 2016.
# RepCATV95 Time Changes (2016-12-16) (CANCELLED)
# CATV 95 enacted the Issue Number 1762 reversing the 2015 time change which was set by Issue Number 1130 
# which was enacted on 21 April 2015 (d004-064hd) by Gratrich to counter the hostile acts committed by Jejomar Binay.
# RepCATV95 Cancels Switch To UTC+08:00 (2016-12-18) (CANCELLED)
# CATV 95 cancelled the time change indefinitely for security reasons.
# RepCATV95 Continues With 2017 Time Change (2016-12-20) (CANCELLED)

# RepCATV95 Continues Observing Half-Hour Time Zone Permanently (2016-12-21) (CANCELLED)

# As a convenient way to reduce the time difference between RCATV95 and STI's time zones by 30 mins.
# Issue #1762 Is Now Ignored By CATV 95 In 2017 (2016-12-31)
# This is to have the 30-minute difference between PST (UT+8) and CATV 95's time (UT+7.5).
# CATV 95 Banned Philippine Standard Time From 2017 Onwards (2017-01-02)

# CATV 95 Forced To Resume 2017 Time Change In 2017 (2017-01-04) (CANCELLED)
# CATV 95 Will Finally Effect Issue #1762 On January 5, 2017. The time change is now taking place at 11:30 pm.
# 2017 Time Change Is Impossible For CATV 95 (2017-01-07)
# Due to unforeseen consequences as in 2015, CATV 95 will remain on UT+7.5 for now.
# CATV 95 Uses DST For 2017 Holy Week Only (2017-01-14)
# Due to incoming holy week in 2017, CATV 95 will run the DST for 9 days, turning clocks by fifteen minutes only instead of one hour.
# Instead of returning to UTC+8 before January 23, 2017 under the pressure from Carlo J. Josue III, 
# John Joshua L. Nogoy, and Norris Alexis P. Amora, CATV 95 will try revive the Iran-style DST sometime in 2021.

# The Masquerade
# The Masquerade Failed To Scrap Panot's Time (2010-07-15)
# Due to harsh behavior of anti-establishment groups (of central america) who opposed both Philippine Time and TMST in all levels.
# The Masquerade Unsuccessfully Made Eucla Time Permanent (2012-08-19)
# In years 2010 and 2012, TM2013 attempted to changed its time zone to UT+8.75 but it was reverted to NOT 
# by anti-establishment groups who opposed 
# both the Liberal Party and Joseph Estrada's UNA.
# TM2013 Drops Panot's Time For Eucla Time (2013-11-26)
# TM2013 scrapped Panot's Time because it, like CATV 95 and Juanders, also 
# suffered the same impediments as Western Samoans from 1892 to 2011.
# Prior to June 17, 2016 used UT+8.75 same as Eucla.
# From 2016 to 2017, TM2013 has used UT+8.5 as its time zone.
