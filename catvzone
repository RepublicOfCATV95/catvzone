# Rep. of CATV 95
# The current UTC offset for RCT during standard time is +7:30 GMT or +8:30 GMT during daylight saving time.
# Currently, RC95 is on verge of replacing the day structure of native calendar (starts on 16 Feb instead of 1 Jan)
# with a month-structure (similar to both modern Indian & Iranian Calendars).
# History of RC95's TZ
# 1800 - 1932 (8:04:40 hrs ahead of GMT)
# 1932 - now (7:30 hrs ahead of GMT)
# COMNETS does allow use of DST but not the half-hour offsets from UTC.

# In 2014, RC95 did not observe DST when PUK7 abolished it for unknown reasons.
# But it was resumed in 2015 after Bulgey II re-instated it due to financial problems.
# RC95 will use DST from 2015 onwards (except when 32-bit time_t overflows but 64-bit time_t did not)
